# Automated-Hydroponics-Aeroponics
Beginning Arduino Hydroponics/Aeroponics Project
This is my initial project with Arduino. I hope to automate the main functions of an Hydroponics and or Aeroponics system.

The sensors used in this project will be:

TDS Total Dissolved Solids= This will provide a PPM/ECM signal to give the nutrient level reading and dosage. The single nutrient pump will be turned on and off by this signal.

PH Sensor = Gives a signal indicating the PH level of the nutrient tank and turns the Acid pump on to regulate PH on tank.

Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensors x4 (Hydro)= These will give a signal indicating Moisture Level of soil and will Activate the Feed pump for that plant.

4x Relay Module= To engage Feed Pumps as needed.

Water Level Sensors x2 (Aero/Aqua)= These will be used to maintain the levels in the Planter Basins and the Nutrient Tank.

Arduino Uno Microcontroller = Processing

Sensor Shield for Uno= Adaptor for UNO to receive more sensors.


I am going to atempt to locate a library code for each of these sensors and retrieve the data needed to maintain the correct Nutrient Consintration, PH and Feed to plants through the operation of various Pumps.
